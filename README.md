<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview
![screenshot](https://github.com/afuentes11/404-not-found-devChallenges/blob/master/img/web.gif)

The project consists of the creation of a responsive 404 error page. The design was provided by Devchallenges in the challenge.

The page can be viewed at the following [link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andresfuentesmartinez/). If you liked the project, give me a star ‚≠ê.

The development of the challenge allowed me to reinforce my layout skills using css and html, to the point of being able to add animations.
